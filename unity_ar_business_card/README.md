# AR Business Card with Vuforia

## Project Overview
The **AR Business Card** is an interactive augmented reality experience that brings your traditional business card into the digital realm. By scanning a custom image target, users can view animated buttons and text that display personal information such as name, title, and contact links. The AR interface features functional buttons that open relevant websites, social media profiles, or email clients, providing an engaging and dynamic way to interact with professional contact details. This project integrates Unity and Vuforia for real-time image recognition, with animations triggered upon target detection.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality**: The project uses Vuforiaâ€™s image recognition capabilities to detect a custom image target and display a corresponding AR interface.
- **Interactive UI**: The AR interface includes buttons that link to email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Medium.
- **Smooth Animations**: The buttons and text animate smoothly into view once the image target is detected, enhancing the user experience.
- **Multi-platform Support**: The project is built for both Android and iOS platforms.
