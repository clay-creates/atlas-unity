# Atlas Unity

![Atlas Unity in Action](path-to-screenshot.png)

**Atlas Unity** is a comprehensive 3D platformer and AR/VR project hub, compiled from months of iterative development in Unity. This repository showcases various Unity projects, from early experiments to polished iterations, each building toward creating visually engaging and technically refined applications. The main project is a 3D platformer game, but the repository also includes AR and VR mini-projects, making it a versatile reference point for Unity developers.

## Project Overview

Atlas Unity began as a simple 3D platformer project and expanded into a hub of Unity experiences, each iteration refining various aspects such as animations, user interface, audio, and AR integration. This evolution reflects both technical growth and design experimentation, with a focus on leveraging Unity’s robust features to produce dynamic and interactive experiences. The goal is to offer users a deep dive into Unity’s potential for cross-disciplinary applications.

## Project Components

The repository includes several sub-projects, each of which highlights different Unity skills and techniques:

### `unity-animation`
An iteration of our 3D platformer game where animations were added to the player model, enhancing interactivity and visual feedback.

### `unity-ar_slingshot_game`
An ongoing project to create an AR slingshot game, using mechanics inspired by Angry Birds and Pokémon Go. The game incorporates slingshot physics and plane detection to place targets in augmented reality.

### `unity-assets_models_textures`
The first iteration of our 3D platformer, focusing on building level assets and scenery for an immersive first level.

### `unity-assets_ui`
This iteration introduced user interface elements, including menus, HUD, and a pause menu, establishing the project’s visual and interactive framework.

### `unity-user_interface`
A foundational project where we explored Unity’s user interface tools, following structured tasks to demonstrate proficiency in UI design and interactivity.

### `unity_ar_business_card`
An augmented reality business card created with Vuforia. When scanned, it displays a digital business card with interactive buttons and animations, offering a unique way to share contact information.

### `unity_audio`
The final iteration of our 3D platformer, focusing on audio integration. We added sounds to the player and environment, enriching the user experience with spatial audio cues.

### `unity_concepts`
This project focused on foundational Unity concepts, such as physics materials, prefabs, and custom materials, used to enhance gameplay dynamics and visual consistency.

### `unity_publishing`
An early project exploring the basics of building and publishing games in Unity, including configuring build settings for proper game distribution.
